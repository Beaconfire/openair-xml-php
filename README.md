## Synopsis

This project is designed to interact cleanly with NetSuite's OpenAir Application using XML and PHP.

## Code Example

see example.php

## Motivation

A project I'm building for my company and wanted to write a comprehensive service to interact with the API

## Installation

Using the code is fairly simple.  Curently there's no installation method, just clone the code, and start editing the example file.  The autoloader will register all of the classes for you, so that should be included first.

## API Reference

Doc coming later.  For now, see example.php.

## Tests

Coming Soon
